  :contents: High Availability Routing for Postgres (HARP) is a cluster-management
    tool for  edb_lk_asis_1  clusters. The core design of  the tool is to route all
    application traffic in a single data center or  region to only one node at a time.
    This node, designated the lead master, acts  as the principle write target to
    reduce the potential for data conflicts.

  :contents: HARP leverages a distributed consensus model to determine availability
    of the  BDR nodes in the cluster. On failure or unavailability of the lead master,
    HARP  elects a new lead master and redirects application traffic.
