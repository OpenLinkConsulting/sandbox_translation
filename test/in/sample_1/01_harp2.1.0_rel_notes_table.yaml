  - Type: Feature
    Description: The BDR DCS now uses a push notification from the consensus rather
      than through polling nodes. <p>This change reduces the time for new leader selection
      and the load that HARP does on the BDR DCS since it doesn't need to poll in
      short intervals anymore.</p>
  - Type: Feature
    Description: TPA now restarts each HARP Proxy one by one and wait until they come
      back to reduce any downtime incurred by the application during software upgrades.
  - Type: Feature
    Description: The support for embedding PGBouncer directly into HARP Proxy is now
      deprecated and will be removed in the next major release of HARP. <p>It's now
      possible to configure TPA to put PGBouncer on the same node as HARP Proxy and
      point to that HARP Proxy. </p>
