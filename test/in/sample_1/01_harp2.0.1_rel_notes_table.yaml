  - Type: "----"
    Description: "------------"
  - Type: Enhancement
    Description: Support for selecting a leader per location rather than relying on
      DCS like etcd to have separate setup in different locations. This still requires
      a majority of nodes to survive loss of a location, so an odd number of both
      locations and database nodes is recommended.
  - Type: Enhancement
    Description: The BDR DCS now uses a push notification from the consensus rather
      than through polling nodes. This change reduces the time for new leader selection
      and the load that HARP does on the BDR DCS since it doesn't need to poll in
      short intervals anymore.
  - Type: Enhancement
    Description: TPA now restarts each HARP Proxy one by one and wait until they come
      back to reduce any downtime incurred by the application during software upgrades.
  - Type: Enhancement
    Description: The support for embedding PGBouncer directly into HARP Proxy is now
      deprecated and will be removed in the next major release of HARP. It's now possible
      to configure TPA to put PGBouncer on the same node as HARP Proxy and point to
      that HARP Proxy.
  - Type: Bug Fix
    Description: "`harpctl promote <node_name>` would occasionally promote a different
      node than the one specified.  This has been fixed. [Support Ticket #75406]"
  - Type: Bug Fix
    Description: Fencing would sometimes fail when using BDR as the Distributed Consensus
      Service.  This has been corrected.
  - Type: Bug Fix
    Description: "`harpctl apply` no longer turns off routing for leader after the
      cluster has been established. [Support Ticket #80790]"
  - Type: Bug Fix
    Description: 'Harp-manager no longer exits if it cannot start a failed database.
      Harp-manager will keep retrying with randomly increasing periods. [Support Ticket
      #78516]'
  - Type: Bug Fix
    Description: The internal pgbouncer proxy implementation had a memory leak.  This
      has been remediated.
