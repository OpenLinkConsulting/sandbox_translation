    Description: HARP Proxy deprecates need for HAProxy in supported architecture.<p>The
      use of HARP Router to translate DCS contents into appropriate online or offline
      states for HTTP-based URI requests meant a load balancer or HAProxy was necessary
      to determine the lead master. HARP Proxy now does this automatically without
      periodic iterative status checks. </p>
